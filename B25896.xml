            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU Have already received an Account of the Election of Members to serve in this present Parliament, for the County, University, and Town of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> but were not therein acquainted with that rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Spirit of <hi>Malice,</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> which will be satisfied with nothing less, than the ruin of the Government in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and the Introduction of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arbitary Power</hi> among us; As plainly appeared by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters adhering to, and approbation of the practices of the last Reign, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto; And particularly in this County, relating to the election there lately made; towards the effecting of whose foremention'd designs; they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed that Scandalous and Libellous paper, Entitled, <hi>A Letter to a Friend</hi> &amp;c. to this County, University, and Town of <hi>Cambridg;</hi> as they have done in all other parts of England, to prevent the honest Free-Holders and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the several Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> from giving their Votes for any of those Worthy <hi>Patriots</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and State, Printed in the said <hi>Scandalous Paper;</hi> And for the more effectual obtaining this their Malicious Design; they in this County spread the Venom thereof in their CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTICLES, using Vile, False, and Scandalous Reflections upon some of the said persons therein named; which coming to the knowledg of the Magistrates of the University, and Town of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> they upon strict enquiry into the matter of the said Libellous Letter, caused the following Paper to be printed and dispers'd thro' the whole County, that by this example other places might be warned against this Poysonous and Infectious Libel. The true Copy of which Paper is the following.</p>

                        <p>WHEREAS a False and Scandalous Libel hath been Printed and Dispers'd abroad against several Gentlemen of Worth and Quality, and of known Affection to the present Government; and in particular against Sir <hi>Levinus Bennet</hi> Baronet, and Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> Knight, two of their Majesties Justices of the Peace of this County of <hi>Cambridg;</hi> Suggesting that they were against King <hi>William</hi>'s and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, being King and Queen, thereby Insinuating, that they are disaffected to the present Government; which Suggestions are altogether False and Malitious. The aforesaid Gentlemen having alwaies, and in multitudes of Instances signaliz'd their affection both to the King and Queen, as likewise to the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> and to the end such False and Malicious Scandals and the spreders thereof may be brought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne Punishment: It is desired by those Gentlemen, that all good men will make discovery to some Magistrate of all such Persons who shall be Instruments in Spreading and Publishing of such False and Scandalous Reflections.</p>

            <p>I must likewise further crave leave to tell you, That the Forementioned Paper had so good an Effect upon the Free-Holders of this County, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise upon the Members of the University and Town of Cambridg, that they have Chosen for their Representatives in Parliament, Men of <hi>Honest and Moderate</hi> Principles; Firm to the <hi>Establish'd Government in Church and State;</hi> whom we doubt not, but will upon all Occasions approve themselves steady and Zealous for the Wellfare and True Interest of both. I cannot therefore but much dislike the Example of the Author of that Malitious Libel, who durst have the Confidence to invade the Previledg of Parliaments, in Publishing the names of their Members, which is notoriously done in the foremention'd Paper; for which Reasons I have carefully forborne the mentioning of the Names of those, who would have given up all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations of <hi>England</hi> to the Regulators of the late Reign, who consisted cheifly in many places of Papists, as well as Disenters, and others, who were for giving up the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Test.</hi> Those GREAT BULWORKS OF OUR SPIRITUAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS.</p>
            <p>Nor must it be omitted, how much the Grace and Goodness of the King was abused, who did not only intend an Indemnity and Pardon to all his Subjects, at his Accession to the Crown, in imitation of all his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Predicessors; who did the like; but for the more effectual Grant of the same, did out of his abundant Grace to his People, and for quieting their Minds, leave it to the Parliament to frame the same for the greatest Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Advantage that could be contrived; which those Men were so far from prosecuting, That notwithstanding all the Endeavours made by those worthy Patriots of our Country (Aspersed by the forementioned Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel) to answer the King's most just Desires, these irreconcileable Spirits would never suffer it to pass; thereby making the Government grievious, and hazarding its Destruction, that so they might more easily make that Change, or a worse, which they falsely and maliciously impute to the honest and well affected People of this Nation.</p>
